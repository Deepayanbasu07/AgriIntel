✅ 1. User Testing Checklist (for Farmers or General Users)
This checklist ensures all features function smoothly and your app is usable by non-technical users, especially farmers.

🧪 General Usability
 Can the app load on both mobile and desktop browsers?

 Is the home page understandable to a first-time user?

 Is there a consistent navigation bar or back button to return to home?

💬 AI Chatbot (Crop Advisory)
 Does the chatbot respond promptly to user queries?

 Are responses useful and easy to understand (non-technical language)?

 Can users ask follow-ups (e.g., “What about maize instead?”)?

 Does the system handle unknown queries gracefully (e.g., “I want to fly to Mars”)?

📊 Market Prices
 Can the user select crop and state easily (dropdowns or text input)?

 Is data shown in a readable format (table or chart)?

 Are error messages shown if no data is available for the selection?

☁ Weather Advice
 Is city input easy and forgiving (case-insensitive, typo-tolerant)?

 Does the app show relevant advice based on entered city?

 Does it fail gracefully for unknown cities?

🌐 Multilingual / Accessibility (Optional but Recommended)
 Is there a way to switch to Hindi or other regional languages?

 Is text large enough to read easily on small screens?

 Are buttons and form elements accessible for touchscreens?

🔐 Basic Technical Validations
 Are all input fields validated before sending to backend?

 Is CORS properly set to avoid frontend/backend issues during deployment?

 Is the LLM API protected from misuse (e.g., via rate limit or prompt guardrails)?

🚀 2. Deployment Setup (Docker + Hosting)
Here’s how you can package and deploy the full stack app using Docker.

🐳 Step 1: Backend – Dockerfile (FastAPI + Ollama)
Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# backend/Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY ./ ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
🌐 Step 2: Frontend – Serve Static HTML
You can serve it using Python’s http.server or nginx.

Option A (quick):

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8080
Option B (Docker):

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# frontend/Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY ./frontend /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
⚙️ Step 3: docker-compose.yml (Optional Full Stack Integration)
yaml
Copy
Edit
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    networks:
      - agri-net

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    networks:
      - agri-net

networks:
  agri-net:
🧪 Step 4: Run Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
Then:

Frontend: http://localhost

Backend API: http://localhost:8000

Ollama: Should be already running on your local machine (http://localhost:11434)

☁️ Hosting Options
Platform	Supports	Notes
Replit	Frontend only (best for static HTML)	Use Replit’s web server for frontend, or host backend separately
Railway	Full-stack (Docker)	Easiest option for deploying both frontend + backend
Render	Backend + static site	May need build.sh for Tailwind
Fly.io	FastAPI + persistent	Good for India latency
GitHub Pages + Backend on Railway	Free + scalable	Split hosting setup
